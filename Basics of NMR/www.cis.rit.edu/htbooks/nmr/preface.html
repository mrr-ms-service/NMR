This educational package requires a hyper text markup language (HTML) 3.0 compatible browser, 
such as Netscape Communicator 4.0x or later, or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0x or later.   
This type of browser allows the user to view frames.  
Three frames will be used in this package to simultaneously display text, graphics, and navigation aids.  
You are reading this in the text window.  
The graphics window is in the upper left hand corner of your screen.  
This window will be used to display animations, static figures, references, symbol definitions, and the glossary.  
The navigation window appears in the lower left corner of the screen and has one line of options.  
To experience the full potential of the frames, a screen capable of displaying at least 1024 by 768 pixels with 256 colors is recommended. 
You may be able to gain a few extra pixels in the vertical direction on your monitor by turning off the show toolbar, show location, and show directory buttons under options at the top of your browser.  
A computer mouse is necessary to access the contents of this package.  
The mouse allows you to move up and down in a frame by either moving the slider, or holding the mouse button down on the up or down arrows located at the right of the frame. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Netscape Navigator 7 no longer support the font face=”symbol” html command.  
As a consequence, some Greek characters may appear in your browser’s default font.  
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and earlier versions of Netscape support this command.<P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Organization</I><BR>
This package is organized into 11 chapters.  
These eleven chapters may be accessed by clicking on the chapter title in the table of contents with the mouse.  
Each chapter has several sub sections.  
The titles of the sub sections are listed at the top of each chapter. 
The text of the chapter contains several underlined references to chapters in this book.  
Clicking on one of these will bring up the location in the new chapter containing the reference material.   
There are 50 terms defined in the glossary and 65 symbols in a list of symbols.  
Clicking on one of these will bring up the location in the new chapter containing the reference material.   
Both the symbols and glossary can be viewed in their entirity in the graphics window by clicking on them in the table of contents.  
Each entry in the glossary contains a chapter reference.  
By clicking on this reference you will bring up the chapter where the glossary entry is defined or first used.  
This feature therefore makes the glossary also serve as an index.  
You may further search for a term in a chapter with the edit find command of your browser.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clicking on a reference symbol (<IMG SRC="images/ref.gif">) brings up a reference in the graphics window.  You may view the entire list of references by clicking on the references entry in the table of contents.  The text contains several start (<IMG SRC="images/start.gif">) and play (<IMG SRC="images/play.gif">) icons.  These icons display images, figures, and animation in the animation/graphics window.  The start icon displays single frame images and figures, while the play icon displays an animation.  The bottom of each text page contains markers to send you to the top of the current chapter, back one chapter, and ahead one chapter.  There are occasional references to previous and future chapters in the text.  When the word chapter and the accompanying number are underlined you may click on the word and go directly to that chapter. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The content of this package has been organized so that background material and underlying principles are introduced first in separate chapters.  Each chapter builds on the previous one.  The very knowledgeable student may elect to skip these chapters; however this is discouraged as often times nomenclature, conventions, and symbols are introduced in these introductory chapters.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the best aspects of web-based publications is their ability to be updated immediately, without waiting for a new edition to be published.  <I>The Basics of NMR</I> is periodically updated with new material.  Major revisions are indicated by a Roman numeral located at the bottom of the second title page.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Acknowledgements</I><BR>
