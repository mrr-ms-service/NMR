<A NAME="3.1"></A> <H3>Spin </H3> 
What is spin? Spin is a fundamental property of nature like electrical charge or mass. Spin comes in multiples of 1/2 and can be + or -. Protons, electrons, and neutrons possess spin.  Individual unpaired electrons, protons, and neutrons each possesses a spin of 1/2. <P>
In the deuterium atom ( <FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>H ), with one unpaired electron, one unpaired proton, and one unpaired neutron, the total electronic spin = 1/2 and the total nuclear spin = 1. 
<A HREF="c1-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A> <P>

Two or more particles with spins having opposite signs can pair up to eliminate the observable manifestations of spin.  An example is helium.  
<A HREF="c1-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A> 
In nuclear magnetic resonance, it is unpaired nuclear spins that are of importance. <P>

<A NAME="3.2"></A> <H3>Properties of Spin</H3>
When placed in a magnetic field of strength B, a particle with a net spin can absorb a photon, of frequency &nu;.  The frequency &nu; depends on the gyromagnetic ratio, &gamma; of the particle.<P>

<CENTER>
&nu; = &gamma; B 
</CENTER><P>

For hydrogen, &gamma; = 42.58 MHz / T.



<A NAME="3.3"></A> <H3>Nuclei with Spin </H3>

The shell model for the nucleus tells us that nucleons, just like electrons, fill orbitals.  
When the number of protons or neutrons equals 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126, orbitals are filled.  
Because nucleons have spin, just like electrons do, their spin can pair up when the orbitals are being filled and cancel out.  
Almost  every element in the periodic table has an isotope with a non zero nuclear spin.  

<A HREF="c3-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> 

NMR can only be performed on isotopes whose natural abundance is high enough to be detected.   

Some of the nuclei routinely used in NMR are listed below.<P>

<A NAME="3.4"></A> <H3>Energy Levels </H3>

To understand how particles with spin behave in a magnetic field, consider a proton.  
<A HREF="c4-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
This proton has the property called spin.  Think of the spin of this proton as a magnetic moment vector, causing the proton to behave like a tiny magnet with a north and south pole. 
<A HREF="c4-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

When the proton is placed in an external magnetic field, the spin vector of the particle aligns itself with the external field, just like a magnet would.  There is a low energy configuration or state where the poles are aligned N-S-N-S  
<A HREF="c4-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
and a high energy state N-N-S-S.  
<A HREF="c4-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

<A NAME="3.5"></A> <H3>Transitions </H3>

This particle can undergo a transition between the two energy states by the absorption of a photon. A particle in the lower energy state absorbs a photon and ends up in the upper energy state.  
The energy of this photon must exactly match the energy difference between the two states.  
The energy, E, of a photon is related to its frequency, &nu;, by Planck's constant (h = 6.626x10<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>-34</SUP></FONT>  J s).<P>

<CENTER>
E = h &nu;
<A HREF="c5-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A>
</CENTER><P>

In NMR and MRI, the quantity &nu; is called the resonance frequency and the Larmor frequency.<P>

<A NAME="3.6"></A> <H3>Energy Level Diagrams </H3>
The energy of the two spin states can be represented by an energy level diagram.  
<A HREF="c6-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A> 
We have seen that  &nu; = &gamma; B and 
E = h &nu;, therefore the energy of the photon needed to cause a transition between the two spin states is <P>
<CENTER>
E = h &gamma; B 
<A HREF="c6-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
</CENTER><P>

When the energy of the photon matches the energy difference between the two spin states an absorption of energy occurs.  
<A HREF="../refs/ref-05.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A><P>

In the NMR experiment, the frequency of the photon is in the radio frequency (RF) range.  
In NMR spectroscopy, &nu; is between 60 and 800 MHz for hydrogen nuclei.  
In clinical MRI, &nu; is typically between 15 and 80 MHz for hydrogen imaging.   <P>


<A NAME="3.7"></A> <H3>CW NMR Experiment </H3>
The simplest NMR experiment is the continuous wave (CW) experiment.  
There are two ways of performing this experiment.  
In the first,  a constant frequency, which is continuously on, probes the energy levels while the magnetic field is varied.  The energy of this frequency is represented by the blue line in the energy level diagram. 
<A HREF="c7-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A> <P>

The CW experiment can also be performed with a constant magnetic field and a frequency which is varied.   The magnitude of the constant magnetic field is represented by the position of the vertical blue line in the energy level diagram.
<A HREF="c7-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>



<A NAME="3.8"></A> <H3>Boltzmann Statistics </H3>

When  a group of  spins is placed in a magnetic field, each spin aligns in one of the two possible  orientations.   
<A HREF="c8-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

At room temperature, the number of spins in the lower energy level, N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>+</SUP></FONT>, slightly  outnumbers the number in the upper level, N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>-</SUP></FONT>.  Boltzmann statistics tells us that<P>

<CENTER>
N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>-</SUP></FONT>/N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>+</SUP></FONT> = e<SUP>-E/kT</SUP>.
</CENTER><P>

E is the energy difference between the spin states; k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.3805x10<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>-23</SUP></FONT> J/Kelvin; and T is the temperature in Kelvin.<P>

As the temperature decreases, so does the ratio N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>-</SUP></FONT>
/N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>+</SUP></FONT>.   As the temperature increases, the ratio approaches one. <P> 

The signal in NMR spectroscopy  results from the difference between the energy absorbed by the spins which make a transition from the lower energy state to the higher energy state, and the energy emitted by the spins which simultaneously make a transition from the higher energy state to the lower energy state.  The signal is thus  proportional  to the population  difference between the states.  NMR is a rather sensitive spectroscopy since it  is capable  of detecting  these very small population differences.  
It is the resonance, or exchange of energy at a specific frequency between the spins and the spectrometer, which gives NMR its sensitivity.  <P>



<A NAME="3.9"></A> <H3>Spin Packets </H3>

It is cumbersome to describe NMR on a microscopic scale.  A macroscopic picture is more convenient.  The first step in developing  the macroscopic  picture is  to define  the spin packet.   A spin packet is a group of spins experiencing the same  magnetic field strength.   In this  example, the spins within  each grid section  represent a spin  packet. 
<A HREF="c9-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

At any instant in  time, the magnetic field due to the spins in each spin  packet can  be represented by  a magnetization vector. 
<A HREF="c9-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

The size of each vector is proportional to (N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>+</SUP></FONT> - N<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>-</SUP></FONT>).<P>

The  vector sum  of the  magnetization vectors  from  all of the spin  packets  is  the net magnetization.   In order  to describe pulsed NMR is necessary from here on to talk in terms of the net magnetization.   
<A HREF="c9-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

Adapting the conventional NMR coordinate  system, the external magnetic field and the net magnetization vector at equilibrium are both along the Z axis.   
<A HREF="c9-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A><P>



 <A NAME="3.10"></A> <H3>T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> Processes </H3>

At equilibrium, the net magnetization vector lies along the direction  of the applied magnetic  field 
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>  and  is called the equilibrium  magnetization 
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>.  In  this configuration, the Z component  of  magnetization  
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Z</SUB></FONT>   equals  
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>.  M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Z</SUB></FONT> is referred to as the longitudinal magnetization.  There  is  no transverse  
(M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>X</SUB></FONT>  or  M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Y</SUB></FONT>) magnetization here.   
<A HREF="c10-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

It is possible to change the net magnetization by exposing the nuclear spin system to energy of a frequency equal to the energy difference between the spin states.  If enough energy is put into the system, it is possible to saturate the spin system and make M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Z</SUB></FONT>=0.  
<A HREF="c10-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

The time  constant which describes  how M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Z</SUB></FONT>  returns to its equilibrium value is called  the   spin  lattice relaxation  time (T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>).    The  equation governing  this behavior as  a function of  the time t after its displacement is:  <P>

<CENTER>
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>z</SUB></FONT> = M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT> ( 1 - e<SUP>-t/T<FONT SIZE="-1">1</FONT></SUP> )
<A HREF="c10-2a.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
</CENTER><P>

T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  is therefore defined as the time required to change  the Z component  of  magnetization by a factor of e.    
<A HREF="c10-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A> <P> 

If  the net magnetization is placed along the -Z axis,  it  will gradually return to  its equilibrium position along  the +Z axis at a rate governed by T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.   
<A HREF="c10-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A>
The  equation governing  this behavior as  a function of  the time t after its displacement is:  <P>

<CENTER>
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>z</SUB></FONT> = M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT> ( 1 - 2e<SUP>-t/T<FONT SIZE="-1">1</FONT></SUP> )
<A HREF="c10-4a.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
</CENTER><P>

The spin-lattice  relaxation time (T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>) is the time  to  reduce  the  difference  between  the longitudinal magnetization  (M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Z</SUB></FONT>) and its equilibrium value by a factor of e.<P>


<A NAME="3.11"></A> <H3>Precession </H3>

If  the net magnetization is placed in the XY  plane 
<A HREF="c11-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A> 
it  will rotate  about the  Z axis  at a frequency equal  to the  frequency of the  photon which  would cause a transition  between the two energy levels of the spin.  This frequency is called the Larmor frequency.
<A HREF="c11-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>


<A NAME="3.12"></A> <H3> T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> Processes </H3>

In  addition to the  rotation, the net magnetization starts to dephase because each of the spin packets making it up is experiencing a slightly different  magnetic  field and  rotates  at its own Larmor frequency.   The longer the elapsed  time, the  greater the phase difference.    Here the net magnetization vector is initially along +Y.  For this and all dephasing examples think of this vector as the overlap of several thinner vectors from the individual spin packets.
<A HREF="c12-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

The  time  constant  which  describes  the  return to equilibrium of the  transverse   magnetization, 
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>XY</SUB></FONT>,   is  called  the  spin-spin relaxation  time, 
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>.  <P>

<CENTER> 
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>XY</SUB></FONT>  =M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>XYo</SUB></FONT>  e<SUP>-t/T<FONT SIZE="-1">2</FONT></SUP>    
<A HREF="c12-1a.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
</CENTER><P>

T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> is always less than or equal to T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.   
The net magnetization in  the XY plane goes to zero and then  the longitudinal magnetization grows  in until we have 
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT> along Z. 
<A HREF="c12-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

Any  transverse magnetization behaves the same way.   
<A HREF="c12-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A> 
The transverse component  rotates about the direction of  applied magnetization and dephases. T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  governs the rate of recovery of the longitudinal magnetization. <P>

In  summary, the spin-spin relaxation time,  T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>, is the time to reduce the transverse magnetization by a factor of e.  In  the  previous  sequence,  
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>  and  T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  
processes  are  shown separately  for clarity.  That  is,  the magnetization vectors are shown filling  the XY  plane completely before  growing back up along the  Z axis.  Actually,  both processes occur simultaneously with  the only restriction being that 
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>  is less than or equal to T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.<P>

Two  factors contribute  to the  decay  of transverse  magnetization.<BR>
1) molecular interactions (said to lead to a pure <I>pure T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></I> molecular effect) <BR>
2) variations in B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT> (said to lead to an <I>inhomogeneous 
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT></I> effect<BR>
The combination of these two factors is what actually results in the decay of transverse magnetization.  The combined time constant is called T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> star and is given the symbol T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>*.   The relationship between the T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> from molecular processes and that from inhomogeneities in the magnetic field is as follows.<P>

<A NAME="3.13"></A> <H3>Rotating Frame of Reference </H3>

We  have just looked at  the behavior of  spins in the laboratory frame  of reference.  It is  convenient to define a rotating frame  of reference  which rotates about  the Z  axis at the Larmor  frequency.   We  distinguish this  rotating coordinate system  from  the laboratory system by  primes on the  X and Y axes, X'Y'.
<A HREF="c13-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

A magnetization vector rotating at the Larmor frequency in the laboratory frame appears stationary in a frame of  reference  rotating  about the Z axis.  In the rotating frame, relaxation of  M<FONT SIZE="-1">Z</FONT>  magnetization to its equilibrium value looks the same as  it did  in the  laboratory  frame.
<A HREF="c13-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

A  transverse magnetization  vector rotating about the Z axis at the same velocity as the rotating frame will appear stationary in the rotating  frame.
<A HREF="c13-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>  
A magnetization vector traveling faster than  the rotating frame  rotates clockwise about the Z axis. 
<A HREF="c13-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A>  
A  magnetization vector  traveling slower than  the rotating frame rotates counter-clockwise about  the Z axis    .
<A HREF="c13-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

In a sample there are spin  packets traveling faster and slower than the rotating frame.  As a consequence, when the mean frequency of the sample is equal to the rotating frame, the dephasing of M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>X'Y'</SUB></FONT> looks like this. 
<A HREF="c13-6.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>



<A NAME="3.14"></A> <H3>Pulsed Magnetic Fields </H3>
A coil of wire placed around the X axis will provide a magnetic field along the X axis when a direct current is passed through the coil.
<A HREF="c14-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
An alternating current will produce a magnetic field which alternates in direction.
<A HREF="c14-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><p>

In a frame of reference rotating about the Z axis at a frequency equal to that of the alternating current, the magnetic field along the X' axis will be constant, just as in the direct current case in the laboratory frame.
<A HREF="c14-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A> 
<a HREF="detail/det-c-1.html" TARGET="TEXT"><img SRC="../images/detail.gif"></a>
<P>  



This is the same as moving the coil about the rotating frame coordinate system at the Larmor Frequency. 

In magnetic resonance, the magnetic field created by the coil passing an alternating current at the Larmor frequency is called the 
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> magnetic field. When the alternating current through the coil is turned on and off, it creates a pulsed B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  magnetic field along the X' axis. <P>

The spins respond to this pulse in  such a way as to cause the net magnetization vector to rotate about the direction of the applied 
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  field.  The rotation angle depends on the length of time the field is on, 
&tau;, and its magnitude B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.<P>

<CENTER>  
&theta; = 2&pi;
&gamma; &tau; B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.  
</CENTER><P>
In our examples, &tau; will be assumed to be much smaller than T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> and T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>.<P>
A 90<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> pulse is one which rotates the magnetization vector clockwise by 90 degrees about the X' axis.   
A 90<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> pulse rotates the equilibrium magnetization down to the Y' axis.  
<A HREF="c14-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A>  
In the laboratory frame the equilibrium magnetization spirals down around the Z axis to the XY plane.  
<A HREF="c14-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A> 
You can see why the rotating frame of reference is helpful in describing the behavior of magnetization in response to a pulsed magnetic field.<P>

A 180<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> pulse will rotate the magnetization vector by 180 degrees. 
A 180<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> pulse rotates the equilibrium magnetization down to along the -Z axis.
<A HREF="c14-6.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>
The net magnetization at any orientation will behave according to the rotation equation.  For example, a net magnetization vector along the Y' axis will end up along the -Y' axis when acted upon by a 180<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> pulse of 
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  along the X' axis.
<A HREF="c14-7.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

A net magnetization vector between X' and Y' will end up between X' and -Y' after the application of a 
180<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> pulse of B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  
applied along the X' axis.
<A HREF="c14-8.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

A rotation matrix (described as a coordinate transformation in #2.6 Chapter 2) can also be used to predict the result of a rotation.  Here &theta; is the rotation angle about the X' axis, [<I>X', Y', Z</I>] is the initial location of the vector, and [<I>X", Y", Z"</I>] the location of the vector after the rotation.<P>

<A NAME="3.15"></A> <H3>Spin Relaxation </H3>

Motions in solution which result in time varying magnetic fields cause spin relaxation. 
<A HREF="../refs/ref-08.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A>  
<A HREF="c15-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A><P>

Time varying fields at the Larmor frequency cause transitions between the spin states and hence a change in 
M<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>Z</SUB></FONT>.  This screen depicts the field at the green hydrogen on the water molecule as it rotates about the external field B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>  and a magnetic field from the blue hydrogen. 
<A HREF="c15-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A>

Note that the field experienced at the green hydrogen is sinusoidal. <P>

There is a distribution  of rotation frequencies in a sample of molecules.   Only frequencies at the Larmor frequency affect T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.  Since the Larmor frequency is proportional to B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>,  T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  will therefore vary as a function of magnetic field strength. 
<A HREF="c15-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>  
In general, T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  is inversely proportional to the density of molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.<P>

The rotation frequency distribution depends on the temperature and viscosity of the solution.  Therefore T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  will vary as a function of temperature.   
<A HREF="c15-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
At the Larmor frequency indicated by &nu;<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>, 
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  (280 K ) &LT; T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  (340 K).  The temperature of the human body does not vary by enough to cause a significant influence on T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>.  The viscosity does however vary significantly from tissue to tissue and influences T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> as is seen in the following molecular motion plot.  
<A HREF="c15-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>
<P>

Fluctuating fields which perturb the energy levels of the spin states cause the transverse magnetization to dephase.  This can be seen by examining the plot of B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT> experienced by the red hydrogens on the following water molecule. 
<A HREF="c15-6.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/play.gif"></A>

The number of molecular motions less than and equal to the Larmor frequency is inversely proportional to T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>.  <P>

In general, relaxation times get longer as B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>o</SUB></FONT>  increases because there are fewer relaxation-causing frequency components present in the random motions of the molecules. <P>


<A NAME="3.16"></A> <H3>Spin Exchange </H3>

Spin exchange is the exchange of spin state between two spins.  For example, if we have two spins, A and B, and A is spin up and B is spin down, spin exchange between A and B can be represented with the following equation.<P>
<CENTER>
A(<img src="../images/12-up.gif">) + B(<img src="../images/12-down.gif">) <img src="../images/10-rl-ar.gif"> 
        A(<img src="../images/12-down.gif">) + B(<img src="../images/12-up.gif">) 
</CENTER>
<P>
The bidirectional arrow indicates that the exchange reaction is reversible.  <P>

The energy difference between the upper and lower energy states of A and of B must be the same for spin exchange to occur.  On a microscopic scale, the spin in the upper energy state (B) is emitting a photon which is being absorbed by the spin in the lower energy state (A).  Therefore, B ends up in the lower energy state and A in the upper state.

Spin exchange will not affect T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  but will affect T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>.   T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  is not effected because the distribution of spins between the upper and lower states is not changed. T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> will be affected because phase coherence of the transverse magnetization is lost during exchange.  <P>

Another form of exchange is called chemical exchange.  In chemical exchange, the A and B nuclei are from different molecules.  Consider the chemical exchange between water and ethanol.  <P>
<CENTER>
CH<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>CH<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>OH<SUB>A</SUB> + HOH<SUB>B</SUB>  <img src="../images/10-rl-ar.gif"> 
CH<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>CH<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>OH<SUB>B</SUB> + HOH<SUB>A</SUB>   
</CENTER>
<P>
Here the B hydrogen of water ends up on ethanol, and the A hydrogen on ethanol ends up on water in the forward reaction.  There are four  senarios for the nuclear spin, represented by the four equations.
<A HREF="c16-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

Chemical exchange will affect both T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  and 
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>.   T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>  is now affected because energy is transferred from one nucleus to another.   For example, if there are more nuclei in the upper state of A, and a normal Boltzmann distribution in B, exchange will force the excess energy from  A into B.  The effect will make 
T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> appear smaller.  T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> is effected because phase coherence of the transverse magnetization is not preserved during chemical exchange.<P>


<A NAME="3.17"></A> <H3>Bloch Equations </H3>

The Bloch equations are a set of coupled differential equations which can be used to describe the behavior of a magnetizatiion vector under any conditions.  

<A HREF="c17-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC ="../images/start.gif"></A>

When properly integrated, the Bloch equations will yield the X', Y', and Z components of magnetization as a function of time.<P>
