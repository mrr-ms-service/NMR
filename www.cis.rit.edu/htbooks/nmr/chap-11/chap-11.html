<H3>Introduction </H3> 

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is one of the richest spectroscopies available.  
In previous chapters you have seen how it can be used to elucidate chemical structure.  
In this chapter you will see some of the other more advanced applications of NMR.  
Two of these techniques, solid state NMR and gradient enhanced spectroscopy,  
will assist us further in the determination of molecular structure.  
Two additional techniques will assist us in studying molecular dynamics, 
or the rotational and translational motions of molecules.  
The last technique, NMR microscopy, will enable us to determine the spatial distribution of nuclear spins in a sample.
<P> 


<A NAME="11.2"></A> <H3>Diffusion </H3> 

Diffusion is the motion of particles due to Brownian motion.  
The diffusion coefficient, D, is a measure of the diffusion.  
The pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence permits us to measure the diffusion coefficient.  
The sequence is in theory capable of measuring both the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients, 
but is used primarily for studying translational diffusion.  <P>

To understand how the pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence allows us to measure diffusion, 
consider the timing diagram for the sequence.
<A HREF="k2-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>  
This sequence is very similar to the spin echo sequence introduced in <A HREF="../chap-6/chap-6.html#4.4" TARGET="TEXT">Chapter 6</A>, except that two gradient pulses have been applied.  These two gradient pulses are identical in amplitude, G, and width, <img src="../images/10-delta.gif">.  The two gradient pulses are separated by a time <img src="../images/10_delta.gif"> and are placed symmetrically about the 180 degree pulse.<P>

The function of the gradient pulses is to dephase magnetization from spins which have diffused to a new location in the period 
<img src="../images/10_delta.gif">.    These pulses have no effect on  stationary spins.  For example, a stationary spin exposed to the first gradient pulse, applied along the Z axis, will acquire a phase in radians given by<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/12-phi.gif"> = 2 <IMG SRC="../images/10-pi.gif"> <IMG SRC="../images/10-gamma.gif"> 
<IMG SRC="../images/10-integ.gif">  z G<font size="-1"><SUB>z</SUB></font> dt  .<BR>
</CENTER>

The spin will acquire an equal but opposite phase from the second pulse since the pulses are on different sides of the 180 degree RF pulse.   Thus, their effects cancel each other out.<P>

Consider the following illustration of the effect of the gradient pulses on the phase of stationary and moving spins.  
<A HREF="k2-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>   
The illustration presents the phase of a diffusing spin relative to that of a reference spin and a stationary spin. The reference spin is one which experiences no gradient pulses.  The stationary spin is not diffusing during the time illustrated by the sequence.  The diffusing spin moves along Z during the sequence.  The blue line in the timing diagram represents the time of the 180 degree pulse in the spin echo sequence.  When you put the illustration into motion, the stationary spin comes back into phase with the reference one, indicating a positive contribution to the echo.  
The diffusing spin does not come back into phase with the reference spin so it diminishes the echo height.
<A HREF="k2-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A><P>   


The relationship between the signal (S) obtained in the presence of a gradient amplitude G<SUB>i</SUB> in the <I>i</I> direction and the diffusion coefficient in the same direction is given by the following equation 
where S<SUB>o</SUB> is the signal at zero gradient. 
<A HREF="../refs/ref-39.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> <P>

<CENTER>
S/S<SUB>o</SUB> = exp[-(G<SUB>i</SUB> <img src="../images/10-gamma.gif"> <img src="../images/10-delta.gif">)<SUP>2</SUP> D<SUB>i</SUB> (<img src="../images/10_delta.gif"> - <img src="../images/10-delta.gif">/3)]
</CENTER><P>

The diffusion coefficient is typically calculated from a plot of ln(S/S<SUB>o</SUB>) versus 
(G <img src="../images/10-gamma.gif"> <img src="../images/10-delta.gif">)<SUP>2</SUP> (<img src="../images/10_delta.gif"> - <img src="../images/10-delta.gif">/3).  
Diffusion in the x, y, or z direction may be measured by applying the gradient respectively in the x, y, or z direction.<P>



<A NAME="11.3"></A> 
<H3>Spin Relaxation Time </H3> 

The spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times, T<SUB>1</SUB> and T<SUB>2</SUB> respectively, 
of the components of a solution are valuable tools for studying molecular dynamics.  
You saw in 
<A HREF="../chap-3/chap-3.html#3.15" TARGET="TEXT">Chapter 3</A> 
that T<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP> is proportional to the number of molecular motions at the Larmor frequency, 
while T<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP> is proportional to the number of molecular motions at frequencies less than or equal to the Larmor frequency.  
When we are dealing with solutions these motions are predominantly rotational motions.  <P>

There are many pulse sequences which may be used to measure T<SUB>1</SUB> and T<SUB>2</SUB>.   
The inversion recovery, 90-FID, and spin-echo sequences may be used to measure T<SUB>1</SUB>. 
Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages.  The spin-echo sequence may be used to measure T<SUB>2</SUB>. <P>

For accurate measurements with each pulse sequence, 
it is important that the sample experience experience a spatially uniform B<SUB>1</SUB> magnetic field.  
When inhomogeneous fields are used, 
inaccurate rotations result and the spins do not follow the general equation for the pulse sequence. 
One common cause of an inhomogeneous B<SUB>1</SUB> magnetic field in a sample is a sample extending beyond the homogeneous bounds of the RF coil.  
It is best that the sample be confined to the volume of the RF coil.  
In practice this means filling an NMR tube with sample to a height no greater than the length of the RF coil, 
and positioning the tube with sample in the center of the coil.  

<A HREF="k3-0.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> 

This position will require reshimming the sample if you are concerned about narrow lines widths. <P>

   
 

<I>T<SUB>1</SUB> Measurement</I><BR>

Recall the timing diagram for an inversion recovery sequence first presented in 
<A HREF="../chap-6/chap-6.html#6.4" TARGET="TEXT">Chapter 6</A>.

<A HREF="../chap-6/d5-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

The signal as a function of TI when the sequence is not repeated is <P>

<CENTER>
S = <I>k</I> <IMG SRC="../images/10-rho.gif"> ( 1 - 2e<SUP>TI/T1</SUP> )  
<A HREF="../chap-6/d5-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>.<P>
</CENTER><P>

If the curve is well defined (<I>i.e.</I> if there is a high density of data points recorded at different TI times), the T<SUB>1</SUB> value can be determined from the zero crossing of the curve which is T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> <I>ln</I>2.<P>

Alternatively the relaxation curve as a function of TI 
<A HREF="k3-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
may be fit using the equation <P>
<CENTER>S = S<SUB>o</SUB> (1 - 2e<SUP>-TI/T1</SUP>). </CENTER><P>
This approach is favored when there are fewer data points as a function of TI.<P>

T<SUB>1</SUB> may also be determined from a 90-FID 
<A HREF="../chap-6/d3-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
or spin-echo sequence 
<A HREF="../chap-6/d4-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
which is repeated at various repetition times (TR).  For example, if the 90-FID sequence is repeated many times at TR<SUB>1</SUB> and then many times at TR<SUB>2</SUB>, TR<SUB>3</SUB>, etc, the plot of signal as a function of TR will be an exponential growth of the form<P>
<CENTER>S = <I>k</I> ( 1 - e<SUP>TR/T1</SUP> )  
<A HREF="k3-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>.</CENTER>  
<P>
This data may be fit to obtain T<SUB>1</SUB>.  
<A HREF="k3-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
<P>

The difficulty with fitting this data and the inversion recovery data is a lack of knowledge of the value of the equilibrium magnetization or signal S<SUB>o</SUB>.  Other techniques have been proposed which do not require knowledge of the equilibrium magnetization or signal
<A HREF="../refs/ref-37.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A>.  <P>


<I>T<SUB>2</SUB> Measurement </I><BR>

Measurement of the spin-spin relaxation time requires the use of a spin-echo pulse sequence.  
<A HREF="../chap-6/d4-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>  
The echo amplitude, S, as a function of echo time, TE, is exponentially decaying.
<A HREF="k3-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
Plotting ln(S/S<SUB>o</SUB>) versus TE yields a straight line, the slope of which is -1/T<SUB>2</SUB>.  
<A HREF="k3-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
A linear least squares algorithm is often used to find the slope and hence T<SUB>2</SUB> value.  
This approach can result in lead to large errors in the calculated T<SUB>2</SUB> values when the data has noise.  
The later points in the decay curve have poorer signal-to-noise ratio than the earlier points, but are given equal weight by the linear least squares  algorithm.  
The solution to this problem is to use a non-linear least squares procedure.

<A HREF="../refs/ref-38.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> <P>



<A NAME="11.4"></A> <H3>Solid State </H3> 

We saw in <A HREF="../chap-4/chap-4.html#4.6" TARGET="TEXT">Chapter 4</A> 
that the magnitude of the chemical shift is related to the extent to which the electron can shield the nucleus from the applied magnetic field.  In a spherically symmetric molecule, the chemical shift is independent of molecular orientation.  
<A HREF="../chap-4/d6-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A>  
In an asymmetric molecule, the chemical shift is dependent on the orientation.  
<A HREF="k4-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A>  
The magnetic field experienced by the nucleus varies as a function of the orientation of the molecule in the magnetic field.  
<A HREF="../refs/ref-50.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> 
<A HREF="k4-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A>

The NMR spectrum from a random distribution of fixed orientations, such as in a solid, would look like this.  
<A HREF="k4-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
The larger signal at lower field strength is due to the fact that there are more perpendicular orientations.  
In a nonviscous liquid, the fields at the various orientations average out due to the tumbling of the molecule.
<A HREF="k4-4.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

The anisotropic chemical shift is one reason why the NMR spectra of solid samples display broad spectral lines.  Another reason for broad spectral lines is dipolar broadening. A dipolar interaction is one between two spin 1/2 nuclei.  The magnitude of the interaction varies with angle 
<img src="../images/10-theta.gif"> and distance r.  
<A HREF="../refs/ref-50.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> 
<A HREF="k4-5.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>
As a function of <img src="../images/10-theta.gif">, the magnetic field B experienced by the red nucleus is 
<P>
<CENTER>
(3cos<SUP>2</SUP><img src="../images/10-theta.gif"> - 1). 
<A HREF="k4-6.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> 
</CENTER> 
<P>

A group of dipoles with a random distribution of orientations, 
<A HREF="k4-7a.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>  
as in a solid, gives this spectrum.  
<A HREF="k4-7.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>  
The higher signal at mid-field strength is due to the larger presence of orientations perpendicular to the direction of the B<SUB>o</SUB> field.  This signal is made up of components from the red and blue nuclei in the dipole.  In a nonviscous liquid, the interaction averages out due to the presence of rapid tumbling of the molecule. 
<A HREF="k4-8.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> <P>
  
When the angle <img src="../images/10-theta.gif"> in the above equation is 54.7<SUP>o</SUP>, 125.3<SUP>o</SUP>,  234.7<SUP>o</SUP>,  or 305.3<SUP>o</SUP>, the dipole interaction vanishes.  
<A HREF="k4-9.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>  
The angle 54.7<SUP>o</SUP> is called the magic angle, <img src="../images/10-theta.gif"><SUB>m</SUB>.<P>

If all the molecules could be positioned at <img src="../images/10-theta.gif"><SUB>m</SUB>, the spectrum would narrow to the fast tumbling limit.   
<A HREF="k4-10.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A><P>

Since this is not possible, the next best thing is to cause the average orientation of the molecules to be 
<img src="../images/10-theta.gif"><SUB>m</SUB>.  
<A HREF="k4-11.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> <P>
Even this is not exactly possible, but the closest approximation is to rapidly spin the entire sample at an angle 
<img src="../images/10-theta.gif"><SUB>m</SUB>  relative to B<SUB>o</SUB>.  
<A HREF="../refs/ref-50.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> 

In solid state NMR, samples are placed in a special sample tube and the tube is placed inside a rotor.  The rotor, and hence the sample, are oriented at an angle <img src="../images/10-theta.gif"><SUB>m</SUB> with respect to the B<SUB>o</SUB> magnetic field.  
<A HREF="k4-12.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A>   
The sample is then spun at a rate of thousands of revolutions per second.  
<A HREF="k4-13.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif"></A>   
<P>

The spinning rate must be comparable to the solid state line width.  The centrifigal force created by spinning the sample tube at a rate of several thousands of revolutions per second is enough to destroy a typical glass NMR sample tube.  Specially engineered sample tubes and rotors are needed.

<A NAME="11.5"></A> <H3>Microscopy </H3> 

NMR microscopy is the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) principles to the study of small objects.  Objects which are studied are typically less than 5 mm in diameter.  NMR microscopy requires special hardware not found on conventional NMR spectrometers.  This includes gradient coils to produce a gradient in the magnetic field along the X, Y, and Z axes; gradient coil drivers; RF pulse shaping software; and image processing software.  Resultant images can have 20 to 50 <img src="../images/10-mu.gif">m resolution.  

The reader interested in more information on NMR microscopy is encouraged to read the author's hypertext book on MRI entitled <I>The Basics of MRI</I> located at 
<A HREF = "http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/" TARGET="NEW" > http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/. </A><P>




<A NAME="11.6"></A> <H3>Solvent Suppression </H3> 

Occasionally, it becomes necessary to eliminate the signal from one constituent of a sample.  
An example is an unwanted water signal which overwhelms the signal from the desired constituent.
<A HREF="k5-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>   

If T<SUB>1</SUB> of the two components differ, this may be accomplished by using an inversion recovery sequence, presented in 
<A HREF="../chap-6/chap-6.html#6.4" TARGET="TEXT">Chapter 6</A>.   
To eliminate the water signal, choose the TI to be the time when the water signal passes through zero.  

<A HREF="k5-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>  <P> 
<CENTER>
TI = T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> <I>ln</I>2 
</CENTER>

<P>In this example, a TI = 1 s would eliminate the water signal.

<A HREF="k5-3.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A>   <P>

Another method of eliminating a solvent absorption signal is to saturate it.  
In this procedure, a saturation pulse similar to that employed in C-13 NMR (See <A HREF="../chap-9/chap-9.html#9.2" TARGET="TEXT">Chapter 9</A>) is used to decouple hydrogen coupling.  
The frequency of the saturation pulse is set to the solvent resonance.  
The width of the saturation pulse is very long, so its bandwidth is very small causing it to affect only the solvent resonance.<P>


<A NAME="11.7"></A> <H3>Field Cycling NMR </H3>

Field cycling NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain spin-lattice relaxation rates, 
R<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>, where<P>

<CENTER>
R<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> = 1/T<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB> ,</FONT>
</CENTER><P>

as a function of magnetic field or Larmor frequency.  
Therefore, field cycling NMR finds applications in the study of molecular dynamics.  
The animation window contains an example of results from a field cycling NMR spectrometer. 
<A HREF="k7-2.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> 
The plot represents the R<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> value of the hydrogen nuclei in various concentration aqueous solutions of 
Mn<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>+2</SUP></FONT> at 25<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> as a function of the proton Larmor frequency.
<P>


Many different techniques have been used to obtain R<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> as a function of magnetic field.  

<A HREF="../refs/ref-45.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A>
 

Some techniques move the sample rapidly between different magnetic field strengths.  
One of the more popular techniques keeps the sample at a fixed location and rapidly varies the magnetic field the sample experiences. 
This technique is referred to as rapid field cycling NMR spectroscopy.  

<A HREF="../refs/ref-46.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> 
<A HREF="../refs/ref-47.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/ref.gif"></A> <P>


The principle behind a rapid field cycling NMR spectrometer is to polarize the spins in the sample using a high magnetic field, B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>p</SUB></FONT>.  
The magnetic field is rapidly changed to the value at which relaxation occurs, B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>r</SUB></FONT>.  
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>r</SUB></FONT> is the value at which R<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> is to be determined.
After a period of time, <FONT FACE="symbol">t</FONT>, the magnetic field is switched to a value,
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>d</SUB></FONT>, at which detection of a signal occurs.  
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>d</SUB></FONT> is fixed so that the operating frequency of the detection circuitry does not need to be changed.  
The signal, an FID, is created by the application of a 90<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT> RF pulse. 
The timing diagram for this sequence can be found in the animation window.   
<A HREF="k7-1.html" TARGET="ANIMATION"><IMG SRC="../images/start.gif"></A> <P>

The FT of the FID represents the amount of magnetization present in the sample after relaxing for a period <FONT FACE="symbol">t</FONT> in B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>r</SUB></FONT>.
A plot of this magnetization as a function of <FONT FACE="symbol">t</FONT> is an exponentially decaying function, starting from the equilibrium magnetization at 
B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>p</SUB></FONT> and going to the value at B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>r</SUB></FONT>.  
When a single type of spin is present, the relaxation is monoexponential with rate constant R<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> at B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>r</SUB></FONT>.  <P>

When B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>r</SUB></FONT> is very large compared to B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>d</SUB></FONT>, B<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUB>p</SUB></FONT> is often set to zero and 
the plot of this magnetization as a function of <FONT FACE="symbol">t</FONT> is an exponentially growing function.<P>
